# YouTube-Analytics

Trying to analyse my youtube data using pandas.

Data downloaded from google. Watch history as JSON not HTML. Thought to use webscraping, but this was less efficient.

## TODO

- [x] Get data loaded in
- [x] Plot to get general idea of data
- [ ] Spread of daily videos
- [ ] Spread of hours in the day
- [ ] Most searched keywords
- [ ] Most repeatedly watched videos
- [ ] Most watched category (not sure if very easy)
